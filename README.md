This is the calculator of my research article "Intrinsic Non-Commutativity and Statistical Multiplicity in a Reversible Chemical RÃ©action" (see : https://stm.bookpi.org/RAMRCS-V10/article/view/6276)

It serves as a formal demonstration of a deterministic/stochastic theory for quantum chemical system computing, validated through NMR experiments.

The Processing code was written on Windows system, and should be checked for compatibility on other systems with regard to keyboard testings. 

Attention : the algorithm can become CPU demanding when augmenting the N value above 20000 takes per orbit on any average laptop !

Feel free to explore with this piece of software to better understand the theory.
